"""Safety policy for the live bridge (Layer 1b).

The ``live_*`` tools drive a *running* ArcGIS Pro session, so unlike the headless
``pro_*`` tools they can change what a human analyst is actively looking at. Two
guard rails sit in front of the bridge and are enforced **here, client-side,
before any HTTP request is sent** (so a blocked command never even reaches the
add-in):

* **Read-only mode** (``ARCGIS_BRIDGE_READONLY``) — blocks every command that
  changes data, the map's contents, or the disk. Reads and navigation stay
  allowed so the agent can still answer questions about the open session.
* **Destructive confirmation** — a small set of commands can irreversibly
  overwrite or delete data; they require an explicit ``confirm=True`` so the
  agent (and user) opt in deliberately.

Mirroring the wire contract in ``docs/PROTOCOL.md``, command names here are the
protocol commands (``run_gp``), not the tool names (``live_run_gp``).
